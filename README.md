PROJECT 3 OHMYFOOD

this is my professional project number 3 of my OpenClassrooms training, carried out on the basis of constraints and functional specificities.

Here is the link to the site: https://loicanael.github.io/LoicAnael_3_02012022/

Ohmyfood! is a young startup that would like to impose itself on the catering market. The goal is to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose their meal menu so that the dishes are ready when they arrive. No more waiting times at the restaurant!

Technology
● The development must be done in CSS, without JavaScript.
● No framework should be used, on the other hand the use of SASS would be a
more.
● No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
● All code must be versioned on GitHub and the site must be accessible on
Github Pages when complete.

Compatibility
The target being people connected and in a hurry, the site will be developed using
the mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile models will be produced.
On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but these supports are not a priority,
their layout is free.
● The entire site must be responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.
● The pages will have to pass the W3C validation in HTML and CSS without error.
● The site must be perfectly compatible with the latest desktop versions of
Chrome and Firefox.

Expected deliverables
Page content
Home page (x1)
● Display of restaurant locations. Eventually it will be possible to choose
location to find restaurants near a certain place.
● A short presentation of the company.
● A section containing the 4 menus in card form. By clicking on the map,
the user is redirected to the menu page.
Menu Pages (x4)
● 4 pages each containing the menu of a restaurant.
Footer
● The footer is identical on all pages.
● When clicking on “Contact”, a forwarding to an e-mail address is made.
Header
● The header is present on all pages.
● On the home page, it contains the site logo.
● On the menu pages, it also contains a button to return to the home page.

Graphic effects and animations
Effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model. They will have to use
CSS animations or transitions, no JavaScript or library.
Buttons
● On hover, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly.
The drop shadow should also be more visible.
● Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a
heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the model. On click, it will have to
fill gradually. For this first version, the effect may appear at
hover on desktop instead of click.
Home page
● When the application has more menus, a “loading spinner” will be needed. On
this model, we want to have a preview of it. It should appear for 1 to
3 seconds when you get to the home page, cover the entire screen, and
use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined,
any proposal is therefore welcome as long as it is consistent with the charter
website graphics.
menu pages
● Upon arrival on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight
time lag. They can either appear one by one or in groups
"Starter, main course and dessert". An example of the expected effect is provided.
● The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on them.
This brings up a small checkmark to the right of the dish. This tick will have to slide from
right to left. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover
on desktop instead of click. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with
suspension points. An example of the expected effect is provided.
